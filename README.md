# nappmono: Name Application Monorepo

**Work in progress!**

Full stack web dev project. Repository contains backend and frontend for a web application that shows names. They can be found under [`packages/`](packages).

Explanation on how I set up this monorepo is at [monorepo_guide.md](monorepo_guide.md).

## Backend

GraphQL implementation **Apollo Server** running in **Node.js**.

## Frontend

**React** app with caching GraphQL client implementation **Apollo Client**.

## Motivation

Coding challenge and practise. No practical use cases.
